## Hi there 👋

🔐 Security Savvy Door

I’m really good at opening doors in the right direction sometimes with a gentle push, sometimes with a forceful pull, 

and always with a quick glance at the label (yes, I can read).

My profile reads like a Swiss‑army knife: 

Network Manager (I keep the cables untangled), Cybersecurity Analyst (I spot the bad guys before they spot me)

Ethical Hacker (I break into systems so the owners don’t have to).

I love turning “impossible” network topologies into elegant diagrams, turning “unknown” vulnerabilities into documented patches and turning coffee into code.

Outside the office you’ll find me experimenting with IoT gadgets, contributing to bug bounty programs, or debating whether “push” or “pull” 

is the superior git command (spoiler: it depends on the branch).

TL;DR: I’m the guy who makes sure the right doors stay open, the wrong doors stay locked, and everyone enjoys a good pun along the way.
